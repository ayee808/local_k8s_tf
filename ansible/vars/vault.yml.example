# ArgoCD Secrets (to be encrypted with ansible-vault)
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to vault.yml:
#    cp vault.yml.example vault.yml
#
# 2. Edit vault.yml and set your secure ArgoCD admin password:
#    - Replace CHANGE-ME-SECURE-PASSWORD with a strong password
#    - Minimum 12 characters recommended
#    - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
#
# 3. Encrypt vault.yml with ansible-vault:
#    ansible-vault encrypt ansible/vars/vault.yml
#    (You will be prompted to create a vault password)
#
# 4. Store your vault password securely (use password manager)
#    - Never commit the vault password to git
#    - Consider using .vault_pass file (gitignored) for automation
#
# 5. To edit encrypted vault.yml later:
#    ansible-vault edit ansible/vars/vault.yml
#
# IMPORTANT: vault.yml is gitignored and should NEVER be committed unencrypted

# ArgoCD Admin Password
# This will replace the auto-generated password from Terraform
argocd_admin_password: "CHANGE-ME-SECURE-PASSWORD"

# Example of a strong password format (DO NOT USE THIS EXACT PASSWORD):
# argocd_admin_password: "MyS3cur3P@ssw0rd!2024"
